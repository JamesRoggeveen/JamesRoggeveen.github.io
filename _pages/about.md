My name is James Roggeveen and I am a researcher and applied mathematician. I am currently finishing my PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University. My research has focused on developing mathematical models to describe the motion of particles and fluids at low Reynolds numbers. I have developed analytical theories and applied numerical simulations in pursuit of better descriptions of motions in viscous flows. 

I am currently searching out the next exciting step in my career and am particuarly interested in moving in a computational direction.
