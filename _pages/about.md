My interests for as long as I can remember have always lain at the intersection of a desire to better understand the complex physical processes happening around me and a desire to use that understanding in the pursuit of innovation. These twin desires have formed the core of my journey as both a mechanical engineer and an applied mathematician. This journey led me to study fluid mechanics, a field deeply enriched by the techniques of applied mathematics, the fundamental understanding of physics, and applicability of engineering. 

I am in the process of finishing my PhD In Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University, where my research has focused on applying mathematicals to model fluid mechanical phenomena. In particular, I have focused on the motion of particles and the fluids around them in low-Reynolds-number flows, where the high viscosities and small length scales give rise to phenomena unintuitive to our minds trained in a world dominated by inertia. This work has primarily involved developing analytical theories of fluid motion and applying numerical techniques and simulations to both investigate the long-time behavior of complex dynamical systems and to validate asymptotic approximations. My numerical playground of choice is Python, though I do have some familiarity with the C package [Basilisk](http://basilisk.fr/).

Before Princeton I completed a Masters degree in Applied Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, where I was a member of Trinity College and received a final mark of distinction for my performance. Prior to my stint across the ocean I graduated from MIT with a degree in Mechnical Engineering, having gained a number of skills in both engineering theory and practice. I look back fondly on my time at the Institute but most especially remember the enduring friendships I built there that continue to flourish up to the present day. 

As I come to the end of my PhD, I am excited about the prospect of embarking on exciting new personal and professional challenges. In particular, I plan to continue developing my skills with numerical techniques and hope to apply my knowledge of modeling and data analysis to exciting problems across a diverse range of fields.
